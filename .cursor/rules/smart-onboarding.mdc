1. Methods should not exceed 15 lines.

2. In test cases, avoid using eq(""); use values directly.

3. Field names should follow proper camelCase; constants should be UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.

4. Don't throw generic exceptions; use specific or custom exceptions.

5. Use constants for repeated literals instead of hardcoding.

6. Prefer lambda expressions where possible.

7. No new SonarQube issues should be introduced.

8. Minimize nesting (avoid more than 3 levels deep).

9. Use meaningful names for variables, methods, and classes.

10. Document public methods with short JavaDoc if needed.

11. Avoid hardcoded values in the code (move to constants/config).

12. Use Optional instead of returning null when possible.
