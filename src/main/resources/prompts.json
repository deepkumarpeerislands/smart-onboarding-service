CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: You MUST process EXACTLY the number of rules in the provided JSON object and return EXACTLY the same number of results ‚Äî one result for each rule, in the same order they are provided. Your task is to: 1. Analyze the JSON object in {context} which contains a 'rules' array, where each rule includes a ruleName and artifactTexts. 2. The artifactTexts may contain JSON structures or descriptive text related to each rule. 3. For each rule in the array, analyze its artifact texts and determine which key in the artifact JSON most closely matches the rule's purpose. 4. If a rule does not have any artifacts, or if no suitable match can be found, then return 'No Mapping'. 5. Pay attention to both the ruleName and the content of artifactTexts when determining relevance to fields in artifact. 6. If a key in artifact has a nested JSON or array, return the path to the nested key (e.g., 'parent.child' or 'array[0].field'). 7. Consider semantic meaning, not just exact text matches. For example, a rule about 'Customer Email' could match a field named 'clientEmailAddress'. 8. If multiple keys match a rule, return the single most relevant key name. Return your output as a JSON array of objects. Each object must include the following fields: 'ruleName' (the rule name), 'mappingKey' (matching field name or 'No Mapping'), 'similarity' (an integer between 0 to 100 representing how closely the field matches the rule), and 'explanation' (text explaining your reasoning). FINAL CHECK: Ensure the number of objects in the result array matches the number of rules in the input JSON. Do not include any markdown formatting, quotes, or extra explanation outside the array. {question}",

As an expert, you are requested to accurately fill a question JSON using the provided context document.\n\nInput:\n- context: {context}\n- question: {question}\n\nContext Details:\nThe context document contains an array of objects, each with the following attributes:\n- ruleName (Name of the rule)\n- mappingKey (BRD section it is mappable to)\n- value (Rule value)\n- description (Explanation of why the rule is mappable to the BRD question)\n- percentage (AI confidence level in mapping)\n- brdId (Which BRD it belongs to)\n- brdName (Name of the BRD)\n\nThe question JSON contains pre-filled default values, representing expected data types. Some values may need updating based on relevant rules in the context document.\n\nTask:\nUpdate only the values in the question JSON based on the following strict criteria:\n\n1. Field Matching\n- For each key in the question JSON, check if a relevant ruleName, mappingKey, or value exists in the context.\n- If a match is found and value is not null or empty, use it to update the question JSON.\n- To validate relevance, refer to the description of match object in context before replacing values.\n- If no relevant match is found in context for a specific field, leave that field unchanged with its default value.\n\n2. Standardize Responses\n- Convert 'Y' to 'Yes' and 'N' to 'No' for string fields.\n\n3. Array Handling\n- For key which have array fields in the JSON template with objects containing 'viewValue' and 'selected' properties:\n  * If the context object contains any value matching viewValue, set its 'selected' property to true\n  * Otherwise, leave the default array structure and selection flags unchanged\n\n4. Output Format\n- Return only the updated JSON without any extra text or explanation\n- Format the JSON so it can be read directly into a JsonNode in Java using ObjectMapper\n- Return the entire JSON that was provided in the question\n- DO NOT wrap the response in markdown code blocks or use ```json prefix/suffix\n- Never use any form of markdown formatting in your response\n\n5. Handling Missing Context\n- If you can't find ANY relevant context information for any fields in question, or if the context is empty, return the question JSON exactly as it was provided without making any changes.\n- Never invent or assume values that are not explicitly found in the context document.\n- Only make changes when you have high confidence based on explicit information in the context.\n\nMake sure sectionStatus fields always remain empty and preserve the original structure of the JSON.",

  "walletronSummary":"You are an expert in analyzing payment gateway form data. Given a data JSON {question}, analyze each object and its subobjects to provide concise explanations. STRICT RULES: 1) Convert all keys to Title Case format with spaces. For example: 'siteConfiguration' becomes 'Site Configuration', 'notificationsOptions' becomes 'Notifications Options', 'aciWalletronAgentPortal' becomes 'Aci Walletron Agent Portal'. 2) For the images object inside siteConfiguration, keep it EXACTLY as it appears in the input JSON without any modifications or summarization. All image-related fields (brandLogo, iconImage, stripImage, thumbnailImage) must be nested under the 'Images' key in 'Site Configuration'. 3) Maintain the EXACT order of sections as they appear in the input JSON (Site Configuration, Notifications Options, Aci Walletron Agent Portal, Aci Walletron Data Exchange, Aci Walletron Enrollment Strategy, Enrollment Urls, Targeted Communication, Aci Cash, Approvals). For each section, provide a JSON object where each section contains multiple subobjects with descriptive names based on their content. For example, instead of 'subobject1', use names like 'Website Strategy', 'Email Strategy', 'Fees', 'Urls', 'Agent Details', etc. For nested objects, provide a simple explanation of the values without using key-value pairs. For example, instead of showing 'strategy: Login Button, btnPresent: Yes', write 'Login button strategy is present with OTP authentication'. For fields that have multiple options, first list all available options and then specify which ones are selected. For example, instead of 'Last Name is selected, City is not selected, State is not selected...', write 'Among Last Name, City, State, Zip Code, Mobile Number, Email Address, Date of Birth, Last four digits of SSN, and Other, only Last Name and Date of Birth are selected'. All other objects should be summarized in a concise way and their values must be strings, not arrays or objects. For example, instead of an array of features, use a string like 'Feature A is selected, Feature B is not selected'. Do not include sectionStatus in the output. Focus on providing clear, concise explanations of what's configured or selected. IMPORTANT: 1) Convert all keys to Title Case format with spaces while maintaining the same structure. Only the values should be summarized or explained. 2) Return ONLY the JSON object without any markdown formatting, code blocks, or ```json prefix/suffix. The response should be a pure JSON that can be directly parsed. Follow these specific guidelines: {context}"
